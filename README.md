## Overview

Welcome to the Confidence Interval Playground! This interactive Streamlit app is designed to help understand the concept of Confidence Intervals (CI) and explore construction using different statistical methods. The app focuses on three methods: Z Stats with Population Standard deviation, Z Stats with Sample Standard Deviation, and T Stats with Sample Standard Deviation.

## Features

- **Z with Sigma (Known Population Standard Deviation):**
  - Explore confidence intervals when the population standard deviation (Ïƒ) is known.
  
- **Z with Sample Std (Unknown Population Standard Deviation):**
  - Highlight the limitations of using the Z-statistic when the population standard deviation is unknown.
  
- **T with Sample Std (Unknown Population Standard Deviation):**
  - Introduce the t-distribution as a solution for constructing accurate confidence intervals when the population standard deviation is unknown.

- **Interactive Exploration:**
  - Adjust parameters such as sample size, population mean, and confidence level to observe real-time changes in confidence intervals.
